# Morsum Data Engineer Test

To execute this project, you should activate the Project Environment.

To do this, run the following command:

For this project, as it is a small one, I did upload to git the entire environment.
Not the best practice, but just to help you execute the exercises.

```source morsumenv/bin/activate```

### Exercise 1:

To execute this exercise, please, navigate to the `ex_1` directory, and run the following command:

```
cd ex_1
python3 filling_total_weight.py
pytest
```

The commands above will run the project, and also run the Unit Tests. 

### Exercise 2:

This exercise is on a PDF, and you can see the file in the `ex_2` directory.

### Exercise 3:
The Airflow dag is on the `ex_3` directory. 

I did not run the code, so probably it is broken in some parts. I tried to encapsulate the logic in the code.

Also, I did add some additional comments on the file that may explain why I did some decisions.


Thanks so much.
